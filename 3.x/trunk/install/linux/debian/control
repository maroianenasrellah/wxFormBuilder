Description: WYSIWYG GUI Designer and Code Generator for wxWidgets
 wxFormBuilder is a GUI designer for programs which
 use wxWidgets. It is a very WYSIWYG designer, because it uses
 the actual controls to show the result, not some fake representation.
 .
 Features include generation of C++ or XRC code, custom plugin support,
 and import of XRC code.
