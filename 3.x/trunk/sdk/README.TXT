wxFormBuilder Plugin SDK
------------------------
Introduction:
	The wxFormBuilder SDK makes it simple to create plug-ins for wxFormBuilder.
	It is a set of needed libraries that every plug-in must use to be considered
	a wxFormBuilder plug-in. The SDK uses a simple but effective build tool called
	Premake. You use premake to build makefiles, Visual Studio 7.1/2005 projects,
	and Code::Blocks projects. Now makefile and Code::Blocks are the supported
	types that the wxFormBuilder team tests and uses, so your mileage may vary
	with the other build types. 
	
	To create the needed build types navigate to the 'sdk' directory under the
	wxFormBuilder directory structure and type:
	
		1. Code::Blocks Projects and workspace:
			Windows:	..\premake\premake-win32 --target cb-gcc --with-wx-shared [--unicode]
			Linux:		../premake/premake-linux --target cb-gcc --with-wx-shared [--unicode]
			
		2. GNU makefile:
			Windows:	..\premake\premake-win32 --target gnu --with-wx-shared [--unicode]
			Windows:	../premake/premake-linux --target gnu --with-wx-shared [--unicode]

Build Steps:
	- For Code::Blocks, use the generated .workspace to build the SDK.
	
	- For GNU makefiles type: (Assumes you have properly setup your system to build
	  with gcc or MinGW)
	  
		* Release:
			make CONFIG=Release
		
		* Debug:
			make

Includes:

	1. plugin_interface
		wxFormBuilder has a plug-in interface and every plug-in shares this as a
		dependancy. It builds to a static library and should be included in any
		and all plug-ins.
    
	2. Tinyxml++ 2.4.2 (TiCPP)
		wxFormBuilder uses TinyXML++ for writing and reading xml.
		
		You can find TinyXML++ on http://code.google.com/p/ticpp/

Notes:
	- Code::Blocks is a free cross-platform IDE and it can be found here:
	  http://codeblocks.org

	- Premake can be found here:
	  http://premake.sourceforge.net
	
	- Subversion is a great free cross-platform version control manager.
	  It can be found here:
	  http://subversion.tigris.org
	  
	- TinyXML++ (TiCPP) is a great small xml parser. It can be found here:
